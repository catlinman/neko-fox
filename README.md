hotkey users alike.

## Installation ##

As of Firefox 69, you will have to change a configuration flag to enable the
loading of custom themes and style sheets. To do so, enter `about:config` in
your navigation bar and change the
`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.

Navigate to your Firefox profile preferences copy this repositories `chrome`
directory to it. To find the root directory, head to the Firefox menu `Help >
Troubleshooting Information` and click on the *open folder* button beside the
profile information.
